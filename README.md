HOW TO USE THIS
---------------
- Install **XCSoar** (v6.8.10 or higher) on your Android device.
- [Download](https://github.com/stefanix/XCSoarAlps/archive/master.zip) and copy the contained **XCSoarData** folder to the internal storage of your Android device (typically /storage/emulated/0/). Replace any already existing XCSoarData folders. Make sure XCSoar is not running during this copy process.
- Then start up XCSoar and **configure pilot name**, home airport, and your plane.
